# SECTION 5 — The Substrate Architecture: The Full Adjudication Stack

Modern AI systems do not see teams or intentions. They see only the substrate processed through a multi-layer adjudication stack. To understand Substrate Engineering, one must understand this entire hierarchy exactly as it exists in MAS, KAS, and IAS.

## Level 0 — Reality Layer
(Invisible to AI)
This is your real-world business: economics, supply chain, internal policies, and culture. AI never sees this directly.

## Level 1 — Substrate Emission Layer
(What AI Ingests)
This is everything the enterprise emits: telemetry, events, logs, structured data, pricing metadata, and infrastructure fingerprints. This layer is often undesigned, merely "leaking" from Level 0.

## Level 2 — The Five Syntaxes
(The Universal Grammar)
AI classifies substrate across five syntactic categories:
1.  **Signal Syntax:** Completeness and truthfulness of events/tracking.
2.  **Policy Syntax:** Compliance, safety, and risk posture.
3.  **Economic Syntax:** Machine-legible representation of margins and constraints.
4.  **Behavioral Syntax:** Operational predictability (velocity, resets).
5.  **Operational Syntax:** Infrastructure maturity and system uptime.

## Level 3 — Authority Window
(The Trust Memory)
This is where AI evaluates credibility over time. It includes historical performance, long-term consistency, and cumulative behavior.
* **The Rule:** No enterprise can exceed its Authority Window. Most are trapped beneath it.

## Level 4 — Platform Membrane
(Real-Time Decision Surface)
The moment-to-moment decision layer: eligibility, ranking, cost, and safety gating for every single request. This is the closest layer to "control," yet humans do not control it.

## Level 5 — System-Specific Governance Layers
* **MAS:** Auction logic, Quality Score models.
* **KAS:** Retrieval pipelines, Safety filters, Grounding logic.
* **IAS:** Permissioning, Workflow arbitration, Guardrailing.

## Level 6 — Model Execution Layer
Where the AI acts: Bid execution, Token generation, Prediction.

## Level 7 — Presentation Layer
(What Humans See)
The flattened 1D representation: CPC, ROAS, Charts, Answers, Alerts.

## Level 8 — Feedback Injection Layer
(Where Humans Destroy Trust)
Human reactions to Level 7 (budget edits, deletions, panic decisions, prompt churn). Everything here flows back to Level 0, often creating volatility that degrades Level 2.

**Summary:** Without Substrate Engineering, the substrate, the entire stack works against the enterprise. Not because the AI is malicious, but because the entity is not machine-legible.
