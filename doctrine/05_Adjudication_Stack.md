# IAOS ARCHITECTURAL STANDARD (v1.0.0)
**Holonomic Labs Ltd — Substrate Engineering Doctrine**
**The Complete, Canonical, Non-Collapsible Multi-Layer Adjudication Stack**

---

## LEVEL 0 — REALITY LAYER
**The None-of-This-Is-Machine-Visible World**

The Reality Layer consists of everything that exists inside the enterprise before any system processes or emits substrate:
* economics
* margins
* constraints
* offers
* operations
* workflows
* product truths
* fulfillment
* customer experience
* supply chain
* regulatory obligations
* compliance posture
* decision logic
* technical infrastructure
* organizational behavior
* documentation

AI systems never see this world directly.
The Reality Layer is the ground truth — but it is not the machine truth.
**The entire purpose of IAOS is to make these truths machine-legible.**

---

## LEVEL 1 — SUBSTRATE EMISSION LAYER
**The Involuntary Exhaust of the Enterprise (Machine-Facing Reality)**

This layer contains everything the enterprise actually emits into AI-visible space:
* telemetry
* signals
* logs
* structured/unstructured data
* feed metadata
* crawlable surfaces
* content
* documents
* behavioral exhaust
* operational traces
* API calls
* reversals and resets
* KYC/AML signals
* policy adherence/violation logs

AI does not evaluate the organization itself.
**AI evaluates the emissions.**

Mismatch between Levels 0 and 1 is the **substrate mismatch** — the universal source of MAS volatility, KAS hallucination/omission, and IAS pilot failure.

---

## LEVEL 2 — THE FIVE SYNTAXES
**The Universal Grammar Through Which All AI Systems Interpret Enterprises**

These syntaxes classify substrate emissions into five interpretive dimensions.

**2.1 — Signal Syntax**
Completeness, continuity, truthfulness, and legibility of signals.
*If Signal Syntax collapses, all adjudication becomes high-risk.*

**2.2 — Policy Syntax**
The machine-readable expression of safety, authenticity, eligibility, risk, and compliance.
*If Policy Syntax is weak, the entity becomes costly, suppressed, or excluded.*

**2.3 — Economic Syntax**
Machine-readable articulation of economic truth: margins, constraints, cycles, refunds, etc.
*If Economic Syntax is contradictory or absent, agents optimize for proxies, not outcomes.*

**2.4 — Behavioral Syntax**
Stability of enterprise actions over time.
*AI penalizes volatility — instability equals unreliability.*

**2.5 — Operational Syntax**
Technical coherence across the infrastructure: data quality, uptime, structured surfaces, systems maturity.
*Weak Operational Syntax collapses crawlability, ingestion, and adjudication confidence.*

Together, the Five Syntaxes constitute the **machine-facing identity** of the enterprise.
There is no sixth channel.

---

## LEVEL 3 — AUTHORITY WINDOW
**The Long-Horizon Trust Memory of the System**

This layer evaluates the enterprise over time, not in the moment:
* historical reversals
* violations
* semantic stability
* delivery patterns
* refund/cancellation cycles
* metadata drift
* behavioral consistency
* external corroboration
* reputation continuity

The Authority Window sets:
* the trust ceiling
* the trust floor
* the penalty memory
* the recovery trajectory

**An enterprise cannot exceed the trust ceiling imposed by the Authority Window, regardless of optimizations.**

---

## LEVEL 4 — PLATFORM MEMBRANE
**The Real-Time Adjudication Surface (MAS / KAS / IAS)**

Where the Five Syntaxes + Authority Window meet real-time inputs:
* eligibility
* ranking
* routing
* enforcement
* query interpretation
* safety gating
* cost/pricing adjustments
* semantic decisions
* risk evaluation
* model selection

Every request the enterprise sends — impression, token, prompt, automation, or workflow action — passes through the Platform Membrane.
This is the closest layer to “control,” yet still not control:
**the Membrane is governed entirely by upstream trust states.**

---

## LEVEL 5 — SYSTEM-SPECIFIC GOVERNANCE LAYERS
**Each AI Economy Adds Its Own Governance Stack**

**MAS (Marketing Algorithmic Systems)**
* auction logic
* quality scoring
* inventory allocation
* PMAX routing
* policy enforcement layers
* creative interpretation models

**KAS (LLMs & Retrieval Systems)**
* retrieval governance
* hallucination suppression
* grounding
* answer ranking
* safety filters
* persona/mode transitions

**IAS (Internal AI Systems)**
* permissioning
* role-bound execution
* safety rails
* workflow arbitration
* policy gating
* escalation logic

These layers determine what the system is allowed to do on behalf of the enterprise.

---

## LEVEL 6 — MODEL EXECUTION LAYER
**The Layer Humans Mistake for the Whole System**

Execution is merely the final step:
* **MAS:** bid execution, placement, routing
* **KAS:** generation, citation, retrieval fusion
* **IAS:** prediction, task execution, automation

Execution does not originate decisions — it only expresses decisions already made upstream.

---

## LEVEL 7 — PRESENTATION LAYER
**The Human Illusion Layer (The 1D Projection of a 7D Process)**

What humans see:
* **MAS:** CPC, CPA, ROAS, charts, volatility metrics.
* **KAS:** LLM responses, rankings, omissions.
* **IAS:** recommendations, dashboards, flags, workflows.

The presentation layer is a flattened artefact, not the adjudication process.
Optimizing presentation (campaign tweaks, prompt tuning) does not modify upstream adjudication.

---

## LEVEL 8 — FEEDBACK INJECTION LAYER
**Where Humans Re-Inject Noise Back Into the System**

Enterprises introduce volatility through:
* budget edits
* structural resets
* prompt churn
* feed overwrites
* operational reversals
* panic decisions
* workflow oscillations

This feedback flows back into the Reality Layer (0) and Substrate Emission Layer (1)—
**closing the loop and enforcing or eroding trust.**

This is how enterprises accumulate **scar tissue**:
*long-horizon penalties created by short-horizon actions.*

## CANONICAL SUMMARY STATEMENT OF IAOS v1.0.0

IAOS is the first complete adjudication architecture that formalizes how any AI system—MAS, KAS, or IAS—reads, evaluates, trusts, interprets, and acts upon an enterprise.
**It defines:**
1.  what AI sees (Levels 1–2)
2.  how AI remembers (Level 3)
3.  how AI decides (Level 4–5)
4.  how AI acts (Level 6)
5.  what humans misinterpret (Level 7)
6.  how humans destabilize or reinforce the system (Level 8)

**IAOS is the governing blueprint for Substrate Engineering,**
the discipline of making enterprises machine-legible, trust-complete, and adjudication-compatible across all AI economies.

This architecture is universal, non-collapsible, and system-agnostic,
rooted entirely in observable reality — **N = 15,109 empirical cases across MAS, KAS, IAS.**
