# SECTION 5 — The Substrate Architecture: The Full Adjudication Stack

Modern AI systems do not “read” businesses the way humans do. They do not see teams, departments, dashboards, or intentions. They see only one thing: **the substrate your organization emits — and the hierarchy through which that substrate is interpreted.**

This substrate is processed through a multi-layer adjudication stack that ultimately determines your eligibility, visibility, cost, exposure, and ability to scale profitably. To understand AI Harmonization, one must understand this entire hierarchy exactly as it exists in MAS, KAS, and IAS—no simplification, no collapsing.

Below is the complete, canonical architecture, end-to-end.

## Level 0 — Reality Layer
**(Everything that exists before AI sees anything)**
This is your real-world business: your economics, offer, supply chain, policies, customer experience, technical infrastructure, compliance posture, and brand constraints.
**This is the world AI never sees directly. It only sees what you emit from it.**

## Level 1 — Substrate Emission Layer
**(How reality becomes machine-readable)**
This is everything the enterprise produces that AI can ingest: telemetry, signals, events, logs, structured data, unstructured data, crawlability surfaces, product feeds, pricing metadata, consent metadata, content metadata, behavioral exhaust, and infrastructure fingerprints.
**This layer is not consciously designed in most organizations. It leaks whatever happens in Level 0.**

## Level 2 — The Five Syntaxes
**(The universal grammar through which all AI systems interpret your substrate)**
AI classifies substrate across five syntactic categories. These are universal across MAS, KAS, and IAS.

1.  **Signal Syntax:** The completeness, continuity, truthfulness, and machine-legibility of all signals (tracking, conversions, server-to-server integrity). If the system cannot trust your signals, everything above this layer collapses.
2.  **Policy Syntax:** Your compliance, safety, authenticity, and risk posture (eligibility, violation history, identity validation).
3.  **Economic Syntax:** The machine-legible representation of your economic truth (margins, return cycles, CAC tolerance). Every AI economy uses this to decide how expensive you should be.
4.  **Behavioral Syntax:** The operational predictability of the enterprise (resets, reversals, churn, budget volatility). AI penalizes unpredictability because unpredictability destroys trust.
5.  **Operational Syntax:** The structural maturity and coherence of the enterprise infrastructure (site performance, technical SEO, consent integrity, system uptime).

## Level 3 — Authority Window
**(The long-horizon trust memory of the platform)**
This is where AI evaluates your credibility over time, not in real-time. It includes historical performance, consistency vs. volatility, long-term policy adherence, and cumulative behavior.
**The Authority Window establishes your trust floor and your trust ceiling. No enterprise can exceed its Authority Window.**

## Level 4 — Platform Membrane
**(Real-time adjudication inside MAS, KAS, IAS)**
This is the moment-to-moment decision surface: eligibility right now, ranking right now, cost right now, bidding interpretation, query parsing, safety gating, and inventory routing.
**Every request you send to the system must pass through this membrane.** This is the closest layer to “control”—and yet you still do not control it.

## Level 5 — System-Specific Governance Layers
**(Each AI economy adds its own governance stack)**
* **MAS (Ad Platforms):** Auction logic, Smart Bidding, Quality Score models, Inventory allocation.
* **KAS (LLMs):** Retrieval pipelines, Memory systems, Answer gating, Safety filters, Hallucination suppression.
* **IAS (Internal AI):** Permissioning, Policy gates, Workflow arbitration, Guardrailing.

This is where the system decides what it is allowed to do on your behalf.

## Level 6 — Model Execution Layer
**(Where the AI acts)**
* **MAS:** Bid execution, Placement, Routing.
* **KAS:** Generation, Construction, Citation.
* **IAS:** Workflow execution, Task completion, Prediction.

Execution is the most “visible,” but still not the source of control.

## Level 7 — Presentation Layer
**(What the human sees — the 1D representation)**
* **MAS:** CPC, CPA, ROAS, Charts.
* **KAS:** The LLM’s answer, Citations, Inclusion/Exclusion.
* **IAS:** The internal model’s output, Recommendations, Alerts.

**This layer is a flattened artefact — a 1D projection of a 7D decision process.**

## Level 8 — Feedback Injection Layer
**(Where the human reacts — and unknowingly creates volatility)**
Budget edits, deletions, resets, panic decisions, overnight changes, feeds overwritten, prompt churn.
**This is where most organizations destroy trust without knowing it.** Everything here flows back to Level 0, completing the loop.

## Summary
Section 5 explains precisely what AI sees, how it judges, and how it acts. It shows why volatility and cost inflation happen.
Without harmonizing the substrate, the entire stack works against the enterprise. Not because the AI is malicious — but because the entity is not machine-legible, and therefore cannot be trusted.
