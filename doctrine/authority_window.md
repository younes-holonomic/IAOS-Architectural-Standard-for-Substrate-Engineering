# ⟡ AUTHORITY WINDOW
**The Machine-Legible Ledger of Historical Integrity, Constraint Fidelity, and Trust Trajectory**

## LAYER 1 — Conceptual Definition
The Authority Window is the machine-readable evaluation of an enterprise’s historical trustworthiness across all syntactic dimensions.

Where the Five Syntaxes describe the enterprise’s substrate in the *present*,
the Authority Window encodes:
* past behavior
* historical consistency
* violation patterns
* trajectory of trust
* stability over time

It is, in doctrinal terms:
**the enterprise’s long-horizon trust state as perceived by AI systems.**

It is not reputation in the human sense.
It is not sentiment.
It is not optional.
It is a **computational ledger** of:
* constraint adherence
* policy compliance
* economic honesty
* signal integrity
* operational stability
* semantic coherence
over a long temporal window.

The Authority Window is therefore:
**The historical adjudication layer that sits above the Five Syntaxes and informs every platform’s trust threshold for eligibility, exposure, cost, and autonomy.**

---

## LAYER 2 — What the Authority Window Actually Measures
The Authority Window is composed of four machine-legible dimensions, each exposing a long-horizon truth about the enterprise:

### 1. Historical Integrity
Has this enterprise been stable, predictable, and honest across time?
AI evaluates:
* semantic stability
* signal consistency
* accuracy of declarations
* absence of contradictory states
* reliability of historical submissions
* long-horizon fidelity of data

**Integrity drift lowers authority.**

### 2. Violation Ledger
Every violation produces scar tissue.
AI agents maintain:
* policy breach logs
* dangerous pattern memories
* quality degradation histories
* fraud-like signals
* safety violations
* abrupt reversals
* instability footprints

These are not “forgotten.”
**They accumulate and shape future adjudication.**

### 3. Constraint Reliability
AI asks one question:
*Does this enterprise follow its own rules?*
It checks:
* do declared constraints match observed behavior?
* do economic floors actually hold?
* are policies enforced consistently?
* are operational actions aligned to stated semantics?

**Break your own rules → lose authority.**

### 4. Trust Trajectory
AI evaluates direction:
* Is this entity improving?
* Stabilizing?
* Fragmenting?
* Declining?

Trajectory matters more than any individual event.
**Long-horizon improvement strengthens authority even after past violations.**

## LAYER 3 — Why the Authority Window Exists
AI needs to know:
* Is this environment safe to trust?
* Has it behaved consistently over time?
* Will it violate expectations under pressure?
* Does it maintain coherent state across months, not hours?

Because AI systems are non-anthropomorphic, they rely exclusively on historical machine-observable facts.
Thus:
**The Authority Window is the historical read of the Five Syntaxes over time.**
**It is the machine’s view of the entity’s credibility trajectory.**

## LAYER 4 — The Authority Window Across MAS, KAS, IAS

### A. MAS (Marketing Algorithmic Systems)
MAS maintains long-term trust stores such as: conversion reliability history, policy violation history, budget anomaly history, quality score trajectories, feed accuracy over time, site integrity memory, operational stability logs, sudden reversals / resets.

**MAS does not trust “changes.” MAS trusts trajectories.**

Historical authority directly affects: CPC, eligibility, learning speed, distribution, volatility, model confidence, threshold for automation.
**MAS memory explains why identical setups do not produce identical results.**

### B. KAS (LLMs and Retrieval Systems)
KAS maintains: document consistency memory, semantic coherence history, factual stability logs, hallucination triggers, retrieval drift history, correction behavior.

KAS authority determines: specificity, truth retention, ranking reliability, confidence scores, refusal / deferral patterns.
**KAS will not produce high-specificity outputs for low-authority substrates.**

### C. IAS (Internal AI Systems) — *most deeply authority-bound*
IAS maintains: workflow reliability memory, error handling patterns, operational drift history, policy override logs, semantic discipline, economic truth adherence, execution integrity history.

IAS authority determines: autonomy level, decision scope, delegation rights, actionability, error recovery pathways.
**IAS will not become autonomous in low-authority environments.**

---

## LAYER 5 — Authority Window Failure Modes (Scar Tissue)
Scar tissue is the cumulative penalty on trust.
It is formed by:
* broken constraints
* contradictory signals
* unresolved violations
* high-frequency system churn
* surface-level patches
* semantic reversals
* unexplained resets
* budget/signal manipulation
* inconsistent overrides
* missing follow-through

Scar tissue makes the enterprise look: volatile, unpredictable, unsafe, inconsistent, high-risk.

This reduces:
* distribution in MAS
* specificity in KAS
* autonomy in IAS

**The enterprise becomes “untrustworthy to optimize.”**

## LAYER 6 — The Role of the Authority Window in the Substrate Hierarchy
The substrate hierarchy is:
1.  Reality Layer
2.  Substrate Emission Layer
3.  Five Syntaxes
4.  **Authority Window (historical read)**
5.  Platform Membrane (system-specific evaluation)
6.  System-Specific Governance Layers
7.  Model Execution Layer
8.  Presentation Layer
9.  Feedback Injection Layer

The Authority Window is the line between “present truth” and “long-horizon truth.”
It is the layer where: consistency is evaluated, violations are remembered, trust trajectory is computed, risk is classified.

**Without the Authority Window, AI systems would be memoryless and unsafe.**
With it, they become: cautious, selective, history-aware, stability-sensitive. This is essential for safe scaling.

---

## LAYER 7 — Doctrinal Position
The Authority Window is the enterprise’s:
* long-horizon trust ledger,
* constraint-fidelity archive,
* historical semantic signal,
* policy-adherence memory,
* trajectory-based credibility engine.

It evaluates not what the enterprise claims, but what the enterprise has proven over time.
AI systems do not trust the present without the past.
**The Authority Window is the machine’s memory of that past.**

---

## FINAL STATEMENT
The Authority Window is the temporal governance layer that transforms the Five Syntaxes from a present-state snapshot into a historical truth profile.
It encodes the enterprise’s trustworthiness across consistency, constraint fidelity, policy behavior, semantic stability, and operational integrity.
This long-horizon ledger defines an entity’s authority in MAS, its specificity ceiling in KAS, and its autonomy threshold in IAS.
**It is the machine’s memory of the enterprise.**
