# SECTION 7 — The Investment Misallocation: Scaling AI Requires AI Substrate Engineering

Capital continues to flow into "more AI" (models, agents, copilots) while the root failure condition remains untouched: **the enterprise is not expressing itself in a machine-readable substrate.**

## 7.1 Unreadability is a Deterministic Failure Mode
AI systems do not scale on the basis of quantity; they scale on the basis of **legibility** and **trust completeness**.
* When the substrate is absent, AI behaves predictably badly.
* This is the same physics that governed the MAS decade: Adjudication is degraded when the enterprise presents as an incoherent, fragmented surface.

## 7.2 The Infrastructural Prerequisite
Investing in more AI without first constructing machine-readable substrate is equivalent to:
* Deploying industrial automation without electricity.
* Installing servers without networking.
* Attempting digital advertising without conversion signals.

**AI is an adjudication system, not an application.** Adjudication systems require a compatibility substrate before intelligence can scale.

## 7.3 The Vacuum of Standards: Iteration Folklore
In the absence of a governed substrate, the industry relies on "Iteration Folklore": prompt engineering tricks, guru playbooks, and best-practice rituals that attempt to brute-force trust into systems that cannot accept it.

**Experimentation becomes culture**—not because it works, but because it is the only available survival strategy.

## 7.4 The Required Shift
What is required is not more experiments, but the infrastructure that makes AI operable:
* Trust-complete syntax environments
* Unified semantic layers
* Governed signal structures
* Reconciled economic truths

**Summary:** The next phase of the AI economy will not be determined by the next model breakthrough, but by whether enterprises build the substrate required for those models to read them.
